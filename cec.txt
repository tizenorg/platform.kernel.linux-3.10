- TX: check if dest == initiator: should probably disallow (CEC 6.1.3)

- re-transmissions: retry at least once, and up to 5 times. Only once for a
  polling msg.

- follower shall ignore frame if data blocks < than required #blocks

- logical address 15: multiple devices may have it with reduced functionality.
  Otherwise LAs are unique.

- TV (0) LA only for PA 0.0.0.0, otherwise 14/15.

- <Source Devices> shall issue a <Active Source> message. (12.1)

- big endian format

- messages coming from addr 15 shall be ignored unless:

	- it is a broadcast msg
	- sent by a CEC switch
	- it is <Standby>
	- it is <Rep Phys Addr> or <Active Source> (if needed by the follower)
	- or it is a CDC msg supported by the follower

- replies may come in any order and may be interleaved with other messages.

- unsupported directly addressed messages shall reply with Feature Abort

- <Abort> (directly addressed) must be implemented in all but pure CEC Switches (LA 15).

- 'Promiscuous mode' where all CEC bus traffic can be dumped?

- devices with LA 15 (unregistered) cannot be addressed directly and can only
  receive broadcast messages.

- If a device loses its PA (e.g. when unplugged), set LA to unregistered.
