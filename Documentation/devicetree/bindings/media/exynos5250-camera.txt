Samsung EXYNOS5 SoC Camera Subsystem
------------------------------------

The Exynos5 SoC Camera subsystem comprises of multiple sub-devices
represented by separate device tree nodes. Currently this includes: FIMC-LITE,
MIPI CSIS and FIMC-IS.

The sub-device nodes are referenced using phandles in the common 'camera' node
which also includes common properties of the whole subsystem not really
specific to any single sub-device, like common camera port pins or the common
camera bus clocks.

Common 'camera' node
--------------------

Required properties:

- compatible		: must be "samsung,exynos5250-fimc"
- clocks		: list of clock specifiers, corresponding to entries in
                          the clock-names property
- clock-names		: must contain "sclk_bayer" entry
- samsung,csis		: list of phandles to the mipi-csis device nodes
- samsung,fimc-lite	: list of phandles to the fimc-lite device nodes
- samsung,fimc-is	: phandle to the fimc-is device node

The pinctrl bindings defined in ../pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt must be used
to define a required pinctrl state named "default".

'parallel-ports' node
---------------------

This node should contain child 'port' nodes specifying active parallel video
input ports. It includes camera A, camera B and RGB bay inputs.
'reg' property in the port nodes specifies the input type:
 1 - parallel camport A
 2 - parallel camport B
 5 - RGB camera bay

3, 4 are for MIPI CSI-2 bus and are already described in samsung-mipi-csis.txt

Image sensor nodes
------------------

The sensor device nodes should be added to their control bus controller (e.g.
I2C0) nodes and linked to a port node in the csis or the parallel-ports node,
using the common video interfaces bindings, defined in video-interfaces.txt.

Example:

	aliases {
		fimc-lite0 = &fimc_lite_0
	};

	/* Parallel bus IF sensor */
	i2c_0: i2c@13860000 {
		s5k6aa: sensor@3c {
			compatible = "samsung,s5k6aafx";
			reg = <0x3c>;
			vddio-supply = <...>;

			clock-frequency = <24000000>;
			clocks = <...>;
			clock-names = "mclk";

			port {
				s5k6aa_ep: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&fimc0_ep>;
					bus-width = <8>;
					hsync-active = <0>;
					vsync-active = <1>;
					pclk-sample = <1>;
				};
			};
		};
	};

	/* MIPI CSI-2 bus IF sensor */
	s5c73m3: sensor@1a {
		compatible = "samsung,s5c73m3";
		reg = <0x1a>;
		vddio-supply = <...>;

		clock-frequency = <24000000>;
		clocks = <...>;
		clock-names = "mclk";

		port {
			s5c73m3_1: endpoint {
				data-lanes = <1 2 3 4>;
				remote-endpoint = <&csis0_ep>;
			};
		};
	};

	camera {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos5250-fimc";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		status = "okay";

		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&cam_port_a_clk_active>;

		samsung,csis = <&csis_0>, <&csis_1>;
		samsung,fimc-lite = <&fimc_lite_0>, <&fimc_lite_1>, <&fimc_lite_2>;
		samsung,fimc-is = <&fimc_is>;

		/* parallel camera ports */
		parallel-ports {
			/* camera A input */
			port@1 {
				reg = <1>;
				camport_a_ep: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&s5k6aa_ep>;
					bus-width = <8>;
					hsync-active = <0>;
					vsync-active = <1>;
					pclk-sample = <1>;
				};
			};
		};
	};

MIPI-CSIS device binding is defined in samsung-mipi-csis.txt, FIMC-LITE
device binding is defined in exynos-fimc-lite.txt and FIMC-IS binding
is defined in exynos5-fimc-is.txt.
