Samsung S5P/EXYNOS SoC series USB PHY
-------------------------------------------------

Required properties:
- compatible : should be one of the listed compatibles:
	- "samsung,exynos4210-usbphy"
	- "samsung,exynos4212-usbphy"
- reg : a list of registers used by phy driver
	- first and obligatory is the location of phy modules registers
	- second and also required is the location of isolation registers
	  (isolation registers control the physical connection between the in
	  SoC modules and outside of the SoC, this also can be called enable
	  control in the documentation of the SoC)
	- third is the location of the mode switch register, this only applies
	  to SoCs that have such a feature; mode switching enables to have
	  both host and device used the same SoC pins and is commonly used
	  when OTG is supported
- #phy-cells : from the generic phy bindings, must be 1;

The second cell in the PHY specifier identifies the PHY its meaning is SoC
dependent. For the currently supported SoCs (Exynos 4210 and Exynos 4212) it
is as follows:
  0 - USB device,
  1 - USB host,
  2 - HSIC0,
  3 - HSIC1,

Example:

For Exynos 4412 (compatible with Exynos 4212):

exynos_usbphy: exynos-usbphy@125B0000 {
	compatible = "samsung,exynos4212-usbphy";
	reg = <0x125B0000 0x100 0x10020704 0x0c 0x1001021c 0x4>;
	ranges;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	clocks = <&clock 305>, <&clock 2>, <&clock 2>, <&clock 2>,
							<&clock 2>;
	clock-names = "phy", "device", "host", "hsic0", "hsic1";
	status = "okay";
	#phy-cells = <1>;
};

Then the PHY can be used in other nodes such as:

ehci@12580000 {
	status = "okay";
	phys = <&exynos_usbphy 2>;
	phy-names = "hsic0";
};
